jig editor : make edit jig after creation work
  jig editor : modes
    mode_create_editgeometry (edit0?) (geometryunlocked?)
    mode_create_editsections (edit1?) 
    mode_retouch_editsections (edit2?)

Also, instead of disabling buttons just make them nonvisible. It's the better effect.

save should be disabled in editgeometry mode

----------------

jig editor. make info bar work

metagon editor. coarsen grid resolution at init

grid : make sturctures and lines line up better. It isn't quite perfect when the structures get big.

jig editor : mouse cursor is weird in edit sections : inappropriate

redo metagon editor ui
redo grammar editor ui
redo generator editor ui
