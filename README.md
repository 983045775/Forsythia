Grammar Editor and Simple Generator

The Grammar Editor works but it's confusing. Some stuff is gonna be removed. Some noncentral stuff doesn't work. I'll redo it soon.

The Simple Generator uses serialized grammar, composer and renderer. 
You put the paths in there at the bottom. Hover to get button details.

Get grammars, composers and renderers in the samples package.
